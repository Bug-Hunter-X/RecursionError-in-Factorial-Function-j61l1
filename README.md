# RecursionError in Factorial Function

This repository contains a Python program that demonstrates a common error: a RecursionError in a factorial function when a negative number is input.  The `bug.py` file shows the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.py` provides a corrected version.

The original code lacks error handling for negative inputs, leading to infinite recursion. The solution adds a check to handle this case gracefully.
